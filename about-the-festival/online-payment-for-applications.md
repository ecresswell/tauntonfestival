Online payment can be used for most applications. To request online payment, please send your application form in to the given email address, and then email <info@tauntonfestival.org.uk> with your full name, the competition youâ€™re applying for, and how much you expect to pay.

Once someone has been able to review your email, an invoice will be generated using PayPal and sent to your email address. This may take a few working days. This invoice is payable via credit/debit card, bank transfer or any other PayPal supported method. Note that it is not necessary to create a PayPal account in order to pay the invoice.

If you have any questions [please contact us]({{ '/contact-us/' | prepend: site.github.url}}).
