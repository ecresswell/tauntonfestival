Our Festival affords opportunities for hundreds of young people from our local area to enjoy the Performing Arts and to develop their skills. The Friends and Benefactors Scheme provides essential support for the Festival’s activities, not least in financial terms.

We invite you to join us and support Taunton Festival of the Arts for 2016. We offer two categories:-

- Friends: Minimum donation £20
- Benefactors: Minimum donation £60

Benefactors will have a reduction of 25% in the ticket price for all the Taunton Young Musician and Taunton Young Singer competitions.

All Friends and Benefactors will be acknowledged on the web site and in the programmes. You will receive regular updates about events by either email or post.

Paying your subscription:

- Cheque payable to Taunton Festival of the Arts and send to:-
  TFA, Cranford, Bishops Hull, Taunton, TA1 5EW
