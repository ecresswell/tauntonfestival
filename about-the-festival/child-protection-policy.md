title: Child Protection Policy
---

Revised 2012

The safety of children and vulnerable adults is paramount and all, without exception, have the right to protection from abuse. All suspicions and allegations of abuse will be taken seriously and responded to swiftly and appropriately and all the charities trustees, the staff and volunteers have a responsibility to report concerns. Throughout this Policy where “children” are mentioned, this also includes members of other vulnerable groups. Where “parent” is used it also includes guardians and carers.

1. PURPOSE AND FUNCTION OF ORGANISATION: The Festival aims to advance the education of the public in the art of music, speech, drama and dance, in particular by holding an annual performing arts festival. The Festival provides a platform for amateur performance for children and adults, combined with an educational element from professional musicians, and speakers. Copies of this Policy will be sent to teachers making entries and will be included within the syllabus and programme.

Copies of this Policy will be sent to teachers making entries and will accompany the syllabus and programme.

2. THE FESTIVAL ENVIORONMENT: It is the Festival’s policy to ensure that, in co-operation with parents, and teachers, the festival and annual concert or other events, take place in safe and secure environments as far as is reasonable and practicable. This may involve the use of more than one venue for each section. The Festival venues are open to the public. The Festival will use its best endeavours to inform parents, and teachers of this policy.

3. TO WHOM DOES THIS POLICY APPLY: This policy relates to all children under the age of 18 and to vulnerable adults of any age who compete at the festival and have informed the secretary prior to arrival. Children who attend Festival venues remain the responsibility of their parents, teachers or responsible adult acting on their behalf, who must ensure that they are adequately supervised at all times.

4. FESTIVAL PERSONNEL: All Festival personnel are either members of the committee or personally known to a member or members of the committee, by whom they are considered suitable for the duties they undertake. They are aware of this policy document and have been briefed on how it will be implemented. All stewards will wear a festival name badge. In the event of a problem please approach anyone wearing a name badge. That person will be able to direct you to someone who will be able to help. Problems will be taken seriously, documented and dated. Checks are made on all relevant volunteers through the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) where necessary.

5. PREPERATION FOR ATTENDANCE AT THE FESTIVAL: Teachers making entries on behalf of pupils will be asked to sign an undertaking that parents or responsible adults have been informed of the festival’s policy and that they accept these conditions and will ensure that their children will be supervised at all times.

6. PERFORMANCE AND CHANGING AREAS: Parents or teachers, must not allow children to stray from the areas within venues designated for Festival use or which are available to the general public. Designated changing areas will be provided but these along with public areas, will not be supervised by festival stewards.

7. PHOTOGRAPHY OR VIDEO RECORDING is not allowed but an authorised photographer may be available for publicity purposes. Parents or teachers who do not wish photographs to be taken are responsible for ensuring that children are not included in press photographs.

8. LEGLISLATION AND GUIDANCE SUPPORTING THIS POLICY: The Children’s Act 1989; The Police Act 1997; The Data Protection Act 1998; The Human Rights Act 1998; The Protection Of Children Act 1999; The Criminal Justice And Court Services Act 2000; The Children Act 1999; The Protection of Venerable Groups Act 2006.

9. POLICY REVIEW: The organisers will constantly review their policy, improving and enhancing it as necessary. In doing this they will look to the British & International Federation of Festivals for support and that body, in turn, will look to other agencies for good practice, most noticeably the NSPCC and Arts Council of England policy for guidelines.
