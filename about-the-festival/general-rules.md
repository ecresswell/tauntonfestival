<p>1. The Committee reserves the right to accept or refuse entries, to cancel or modify any class, or to merge one or more classes especially where there are very few entries. Only in the case of the withdrawal of a Class will the fee be refunded.</p>
<p>2. In classes with an age limit, the relevant date is 1 September.</p>
<p>3. Where a time limit is specified, any excess of this may lead to the performance being stopped by the adjudicator, or the competitor receiving an adjudication without category (or marks &#8211; drama classes only.)</p>
<p>4. Photography, video or audio recording is not allowed but an authorised photographer may be available.</p>
<p>5. Entries must reach the Section Secretaries (see contacts) not later than 21 September. Late entries will not be accepted.</p>
<p>6. Confirmation of entry and dates and times of classes: Competitors may order a programme to be sent to them by post. Programmes will also be available from Gillian Greig Music, 44 Kingston Road, Taunton, ten days before the Festival begins. No other confirmation will be sent but if competitors urgently need to know exact details of their classes, the appropriate Section Secretary may be contacted by telephone (see contacts).</p>
<p>7. Non-competitive classes. Competitors in these classes will receive a full verbal and written adjudication, but no marks and no trophy.</p>
<p>8. Mobile phones should be turned off whilst in the auditorium.</p>

<p>10. The Festival cannot be held responsible for unsupervised children. Parents and teachers must take full responsibility for all their children and pupils while on Festival premises, and must not allow them to stray from the designated areas.</p>
<p>11. It is necessary for teachers and parents to be aware of their responsibilities in entering any performers with limited physical capabilities or special needs, bearing in mind the limitations imposed by the performing areas. It is also necessary for the teacher or parent to pass on to the adjudicator, via the organiser, any such information that would impact on the adjudicator&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>12. The Committee does not hold itself responsible for any injuries sustained by any performer or member of the public whilst on Festival premises. It will also not be held responsible for loss or damage to property which may occur during the Festival.</p>
