title: About The Festival
---

The Festival is a registered charity and is affiliated to the British and International Federation of Festivals. It aims to carry out, as far as possible, the objects of the Federation, in particular by holding an annual music and drama festival. Aiming particularly but by no means exclusively at young people, the Festival exists to encourage the performance and enjoyment of the performing arts.

Administered by a team of experienced volunteers, it is run on a non-profit making basis with income derived from entrance fees, local sponsorship (received mostly through the sale of advertising space in the annual programme), and from an ever growing band of Patrons.

The Festival employs adjudicators who judge and coach each discipline. They are all highly experienced professionals who have achieved fame in their own spheres and offer teaching at the highest level - all are affiliated to the Federation.

Music classes are held in piano, strings, woodwind, recorders, vocal as well as sonata and chamber ensembles, whilst drama classes include verse speaking, prepared reading, public speaking, mime, acting and Bible reading. Emphasis, however, is on participation as much as on competition and in 2003 some non-competitive classes were introduced to the syllabus.

Every competitor receives a written adjudication, winners are announced at the end of each class and trophies and certificates are awarded.

A Show Case Concert takes place annually, after the annual festival.
