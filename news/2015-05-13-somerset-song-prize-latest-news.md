                    <p>The regional rounds of <a href="http://www.tauntonfestival.org.uk/events/music-festival/somerset-song-prize/">the Somerset Song Prize</a> have taken place, giving adjudicators and SSP representatives a real treat &#8211; and some challenging decisions. The decisions have now been made, and the following singers have been put through to the semi-finals, which will take place at Temple Methodist Church, Taunton, Somerset on 16th May: <strong><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SSP-singers-for-semi-final-2015.pdf">please click here to view</a></strong>. The semi-final will begin with a welcome and introductions at 11:30am.</p>
<p>Semi-final singers &#8211; please remember to bring copies of your music for the adjudicating panel!</p>
<p>At the end of Saturday, announcements will be made no later than 7.15pm on who has made it in to the Grand Final on 17th. Water, fruit, tea and coffee, will be available at the venue, as will rehearsal rooms. Whilst sadly we are unable to help with travel costs, accommodation will be provided for both singer and accompanist for all those appearing in the Grand Final. The church is in the centre of town, so there&#8217;s plenty of scope to explore if you wish to do so (<a href="http://www.visitsomerset.co.uk/taunton/things-to-do" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.visitsomerset.co.uk/taunton/things-to-do', 'http://www.visitsomerset.co.uk/taunton/things-to-do']);" target="_blank">http://www.visitsomerset.co.uk/taunton/things-to-do</a>) or go shopping. <a href="http://www.tauntonfestival.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Taunton-Town-Centre-Map.pdf" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://www.tauntonfestival.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Taunton-Town-Centre-Map.pdf']);" >A map of town is available for download here &#8211; the Church is on Upper High Street.</a></p>
