                    <p>The class times for the Dance Festival 2016 are now available. Many thanks for your support this year, we anticipated a rise in entries for 2016, but couldn&#8217;t have predicted such an overwhelming number of entries that the Festival has attracted.  Because of this, you will notice from the programme that we have had to split the larger classes according to age &#8211; this has made the timing of the Festival quite a tricky task.  We have tried to fulfil individual requirements where necessary, however, we are aware that the timings won&#8217;t suit everyone.  With this in mind, please let me know by the 18th April if you are unable to dance in your class and I shall amend the programme accordingly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tauntonfestival.org.uk/events/dance-festival/">The class times can be found on our Dance Festival page.</a></p>
<p>You will notice that on Sunday 12th June the festival finishes around 5pm. This is due to the Taunton Festival of the Arts Gala Performance that will commence at 6.30pm. If you like to attend the performance, tickets are available via Queens Collage box office.</p>
