                    <p>“Taunton Young Singer” was born on Sunday, 9th March, as this was the first year that singers were heard in a separate competition from instrumentalists. Nineteen young people, 18 and under, took part, each giving a 12 minute recital. The standard was high and the songs interestingly varied. Julian Pike, Head of Vocal Studies from Birmingham Conservatoire, well used to listening to and training young voices, was the perfect adjudicator. He commented on the desirability of competitors singing repertoire that was comfortably attainable. Also he made it clear that he was looking for real communication of the text and music. The competition was a huge success and has no doubt earned a regular place in the annual calendar.</p>
