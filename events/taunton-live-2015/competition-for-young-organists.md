<p><strong>A Celebration of Bach the Organist</strong></p>
<p>Margaret Phillips will be our distinguished leader for a celebration of 'the most stupendous miracle in all music' (Wagner on Bach). The Celebration will include both a competition and a master class incorporating the organ in its roles as solo instrument playing Bach's organ works and as accompanying instrument in a Lutheran Chorale (i.e. hymn tune) as harmonised by Bach.</p>

King's College Chapel, South Road, Taunton, TA1 3LA<br />
Wednesday July 22nd - 10:00 a.m.<br />

Together with her husband, she founded The English Organ School and Museum, a centre for teaching and performing excellence, at Milborne Port, in Somerset. Another feature of the festival will be <a href="{{ '/taunton-live-2015/english-organ-school-and-museum-visit/' | prepend: site.github.url }}">a visit to the English Organ School</a> to see and hear the collection of keyboard instruments there, on the morning of Tuesday 21st July.

<p>Candidates are required to give their age, and the standard they have already attained in terms of grade exams, or to submit a written report from a professional organ teacher giving an assessment of the student.
