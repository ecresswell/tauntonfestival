<p>A feature of the 2015 'Taunton Live' festival is a special emphasis on the music of English composer Gerald Finzi (1901-1956). He is perhaps best known as a choral composer, but he did write in many musical genres, including concertos (for 'cello and clarinet), solo song cycles and of course his major work for voice and orchestra 'Dies Natalis' (Which you can hear in the gala concert on 21 st July).</p>
<p>We will be exploring the beauty of his music, at various locations, performed by top class musicians over the week and we get the Festival off to a fine Finzi start with the event described below.</p>
<p><strong>Come and Sing Finzi! (A1)<br />
St. John's Church, Park Street, Taunton, TA1 4DG<br />
Saturday 18th July, 2015 - 10:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.<br />
Host: Nancy Beveridge</strong></p>
<p><strong>Paul Spicer</strong> is a passionate exponent of English music with a particular specialisation in the choral repertoire. He began his musical training at New College, Oxford, and he studied with Herbert Howells (of whom he wrote a biography) at the Royal College of Music. His CDs with the Finzi Singers on the Chandos label are widely acclaimed. He is chairman of the Finzi Friends and a Trustee of the Finzi Trust. Accompanied by well-known local organist <strong>Miles Quick</strong>, Paul invites you to join him today for a choral workshop built around the music of our featured composer.</p>
<p>Born in London in 1901, Finzi moved to Yorkshire at the outbreak of World War 1 - there he studied music with Ernest Farrar and Edward Bairstow (at York Minster). His first published work was in 1921, but it took a move back to London and acquaintances with such as Vaughan Williams, Rubbra, Holst and Bliss for his career really to take off. Although interrupted once more by war, Finzi went on composing until his death (in 1956) and he is recognised as one of our outstanding 20th century composers.</p>
<p>This promises to be a fine day's music - you will be in the hands of an expert. Whatever your level of competence in singing and sight-reading we are sure you will have your musical life enriched by this experience.</p>
