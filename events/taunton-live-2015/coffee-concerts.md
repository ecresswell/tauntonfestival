<p>Many of the concerts will be accompanied by the Festival’s resident accompanist, Andrew Carter. He has exercised his musical skills as conductor, organist and pianist in many countries while serving with the Diplomatic Service. In retirement in Somerset he is more in demand than ever, as organist, accompanist and choral director, appearing with Amici, Somerset Opera, Taunton  Sinfonietta and other groups, frequently in concert with his wife Lynn.</p>
