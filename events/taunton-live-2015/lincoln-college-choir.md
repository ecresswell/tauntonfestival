<p>We are very pleased to welcome Lincoln College Choir as our 2015 Festival ‘Choir in Residence’. They hold a reputation as one of the finest mixed-voice chapel choirs at the University of Oxford, singing evensong every Sunday, as well as at major church festivals, in the college&#8217;s beautiful 17th century chapel. Containing around 25 members, the choir draws its members from across and from outside the university. In addition the choir has an active social life and strong community spirit.</p>
<p>The choir prides itself on its high standard but modest time commitment (the choir rehearses once a week, on Wednesday evenings). All members of the choir are entitled to free singing lessons, with acclaimed singing teacher Bronwen Mills, and a three-course dinner after every service. (Now there’s an idea! I can think of a few Taunton choirs who might like that.) The choir also tours up to twice a year, most recently to Rome, Durham, Bury St. Edmunds, Andalucia, Leipzig, Erfurt, Weimar – and now of course, <strong>Taunton </strong>and surrounding venues.</p>

We hope that they will enjoy their visit to Somerset and that you, the music-loving people of the county, will make them feel welcome by giving them the large audiences they deserve.</p>
