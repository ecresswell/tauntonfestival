title: National Competition for Young Bassists
---
<h2>Update on 5th March, 2015:</h2>
<p><strong>There have been very few entries for our Double Bass Competition which was scheduled to take place on March 21st.  It has therefore been cancelled.  We are, of course, very disappointed and apologies to those of you who were looking forward to this new event.</strong></p>
<p>Joel Quarrington, Principal Bass of the London Symphony Orchestra, is delighted to be patron for this new competition 'It is initiatives like the Taunton National Competition for Young Bassists that are responsible in part for the huge advances and improvements we hear today in double bass playing and its pedagogy.' </p>
<p>The Taunton Festival of the Arts' new Double Bass competition is an exciting and innovative competition for school age bassists of all abilities. This national competition, the brainchild of David Heyes, offers young bassists the opportunity to prepare and perform a short programme of their own choice and to compete for significant prize money and awards.
