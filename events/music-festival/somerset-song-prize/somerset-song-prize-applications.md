<h4>Song singing &#8211; a personal statement</h4>
<p>The SSP application paperwork asks for a personal statement from singers. </p>
<p>The reference to a personal statement on the performance of song repertoire is intentionally broad, allowing singers the flexibility to tackle this in different ways. </p>
<p>An important aim underlying the competition is to promote song singing and the appreciation of song singing. Whilst the singers competing in this competition are likely to spend a lot of time on learning new repertoire and, to a greater or lesser extent on vocal technique, there may be little time to reflect on what song singing means to you, the key elements involved and how you approach this discipline. There is no single right answer, so please follow your instinct. </p>
<p>There is no need to justify the reasons for including the songs selected by the singer for the competition or simply repeat the programme chosen; but &#8211; simply as an example &#8211; singers are welcome to highlight if there is a theme or message that weaves the programme together and helps to convey your approach. Or you are equally welcome to say that you&#8217;re relatively new to song singing but are attracted to it because&#8230;. </p>
<p>In short, song singing can be a really personal endeavour and we&#8217;re keen to discover what you think. Good luck!</p>
