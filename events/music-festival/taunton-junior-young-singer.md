The 11 competitors, aged between nine and 13, presented an enormously varied programme including music by Purcell, Mozart and Richard Rodney Bennett alongside a range of parlour songs and songs from the shows.  <a href="{{ '/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TJYS_2016_winners.png' | prepend: site.github.url }}" rel="attachment wp-att-1704" data-rel="lightbox-1" title=""><img src="{{ '/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/TJYS_2016_winners-202x300.png' | prepend: site.github.url }}" alt="TJYS_2016_winners" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1704" /></a>All the performers displayed poise and communication – some well beyond their years &#8211; and the proficiency on display made the adjudication a very hard task for tenor, Tom Robson who had the unenviable task of selecting a winner and runner up. </p>
<p>Second place was awarded to <strong>Ellen Steward</strong> (taught by Naomi Harvey) who gave a very assured and musical performance of her chosen songs. The Cleves Cup, £100 (sponsored by Ashfords) and title of Taunton Junior Young Singer 2016 went to <strong>Abigail Govey</strong> (taught by Lisa Tustian). Abigail’s rendition of Rodney Bennett’s The Bird’s Lament had every member of the audience transfixed and the warmth with which her performance was received suggested she was the choice of the audience as well as the adjudicator.</p>
