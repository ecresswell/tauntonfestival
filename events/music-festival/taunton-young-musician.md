## Taunton Young Musician 2014/15
The preliminary round took place at Taunton School on Sunday, 23rd November 2014. It was adjudicated by Ian Smith.

### Preliminary Round Report
A dazzling display of musical ability was on show as nine young musicians each gave a 10 minute performance on a range of instruments (the singers had their own competition running concurrently). Of these, three were chosen to go through to the Final round, being held on Sunday, 8th February 2015 at the prestigious Castle Hotel in Taunton. These finalists were, in no particular order:

- **Victoria Creighton**, a flautist studying at Wells Cathedral School
- **Olivier Kinsella**, classical guitarist at The Park Community School in Barnstaple
- **Malgorzata (‘Maggie’) Kasprzak**, a cellist at Bruton School for Girls

The distinguished adjudicator, Ian Smith, who had travelled all the way from Bedfordshire for the event, was effusive in his praise of the standard of musicianship on offer, and the varied choice of works being played.

### Final Round
The final round was held at The Castle Hotel, Taunton on Sunday, 8th Feburary, 2015. It was adjudicated by Anthony Negus.
