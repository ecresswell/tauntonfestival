This competition for young singers has been set up by the festival in response to the ever-growing number of entries in the Music Festival. It was also felt that singers should have their own competition and not be judged alongside their instrumental contemporaries as in past Taunton Young Musicians competitions. Finally with the launch of the Somerset Song Prize for singers aged between 18 and 26, the Festival is confident that it can provide suitable opportunities for singers at most stages of their development.




**THE COMPETITION** is open to any voice (apart from a previous winner), who is:

- resident or attending any school within a 50 mile radius of Taunton
- of age **14 to 18** on 1 September 2016
- of Grade 6 standard or above
- recommended by their singing teacher if no singing exams have been taken


A programme of contrasting songs, **10 to 12 minutes maximum** should be prepared.
