The Somerset Song Prize is a biennial national singing competition for young people aged 18 to 26. With a First Prize of Â£1000 the competition is organised through a series of regional rounds followed by semi-finals and a final over one weekend in Taunton. The finals for next competition will be on 13-14 May 2017. Regional rounds will take place in Somerset, Cardiff, Birmingham and London in March/April 2017.

The Somerset Song Prize is a competition for art song and it places a special importance on the collaborative relationship between the singer and their pianist. Arias from oratorios and operas are not permitted. The definition of art song is reasonably wide although competitors must include in their programme a song which is not in their native language.
