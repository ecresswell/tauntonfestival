TJYM began as an addition to TYM, but it was felt it should have its own identity as a separate competition with a prize of £100 and the Jefferson Horsley trophy to keep for one year.

**The competition will be held on Sat 25th February 2017 at 9:30 am at Temple Methodist Church, Taunton, please be here at least 15 minutes before this if you are performing. The competition will finish at approx 1:20 pm, and there will be a 15 minute interval.** 

The competition is open to solo instrumentalists aged under 14 years on 1st Sept 2016. They must have attained Grade 5 standard or above, and should offer two or three contrasting pieces for adjudication, with a total time limit of 10 minutes.

[Our adjudicator will be Richard Deering]({{ '/events/music-festival/taunton-junior-young-musician/adjudicator' | prepend: site.github.url }}), who has wide experience as an adjudicator and examiner both nationally and internationally.
