TJYM began as an addition to TYM, but it was felt it should have its own identity as a separate competition with a prize of £100 and the Jefferson Horsley trophy to keep for one year.

This competition is open to solo instrumentalists aged 13 years and under.

#### Results
The final of the Taunton Junior Young Musician, and those assembled in Temple Methodist Church looked at the programme and knew they were in for a treat.<br />
Eight competitors, all under 14 yrs and of at least grade 5 standard, six different instruments, and a great variety of music.  Delightful!<br />
And our adjudicator, Kevin Duggan, organist at Dunblane Cathedral, had come all that way to hear them (and yes, he did play for Andy Murray’s wedding!).  Kevin was very pleased at the high standard already achieved by the young musicians. He complemented them and their teachers on the attention to detail in their performances and praised the accompanists. He was looking not only for technical merit, but also for flair in communicating with the listeners through their music

The Taunton Junior Young Musician was **Poppy McGhee**, an 11 yr old violinist from Wells Cathedral junior school. She received the Jefferson Horsley Trophy and £100. In second place was **Ben Shattock**, a 12 yr old pianist from Taunton School who received £50. Two great communicators!

Poppy also received the Westlake Cup, awarded for outstanding performance in the recent Taunton Music Festival.
