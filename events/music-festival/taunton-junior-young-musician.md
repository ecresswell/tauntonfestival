TJYM began as an addition to TYM, but it was felt it should have its own identity as a separate competition with a prize of £100 and the Jefferson Horsley trophy to keep for one year.

The competition will be held on Sat 25th February 2017 at 10 a.m. (to be confirmed) at Temple Methodist Church, Taunton. The competition is open to solo instrumentalists aged under 14 years on 1st Sept 2016. They must have attained Grade 5 standard or above, and should offer two or three contrasting pieces for adjudication, with a total time limit of 10 minutes.

Our adjudicator will be Richard Deering, who has wide experience as an adjudicator and examiner both nationally and internationally.

### Results for the 2015/2016 Competition
The final of the Taunton Junior Young Musician, and those assembled in Temple Methodist Church looked at the programme and knew they were in for a treat.<br />
Eight competitors, all under 14 yrs and of at least grade 5 standard, six different instruments, and a great variety of music.  Delightful!<br />
And our adjudicator, Kevin Duggan, organist at Dunblane Cathedral, had come all that way to hear them (and yes, he did play for Andy Murray’s wedding!).  Kevin was very pleased at the high standard already achieved by the young musicians. He complemented them and their teachers on the attention to detail in their performances and praised the accompanists. He was looking not only for technical merit, but also for flair in communicating with the listeners through their music

The Taunton Junior Young Musician was **Poppy McGhee**, an 11 yr old violinist from Wells Cathedral junior school. She received the Jefferson Horsley Trophy and £100. In second place was **Ben Shattock**, a 12 yr old pianist from Taunton School who received £50. Two great communicators!

Poppy also received the Westlake Cup, awarded for outstanding performance in the recent Taunton Music Festival.
