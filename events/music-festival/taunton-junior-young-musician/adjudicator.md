Richard Deering studied with Frank Merrick (piano) - and subsequently with Peter Wallfisch and Clifford Curzon - and trumpet/cornet with Norman Burgess. He has given piano recitals and broadcasts in over 90 countries worldwide, and has also made several commercial recordings - including an arrangement of the Beatles music as a piano concerto with the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra. <img src="{{ '/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/tyjm-adjudicator-richard-deering.png' | prepend: site.github.url }}" alt="Richard Deering" class="alignleft size-medium" /> Many leading composers have written works especially for him, and in 1981 he was elected a member of the Royal Philharmonic Society for "distinguished services to British music". 

As an accompanist he has worked with Robert Tear, Brian Rayner Cook, James Blades and others - including popular singers such as Martine McCutcheon - while for many years he worked as a cabaret performer on cruise liners and as Musical Director for television programmes. Currently, he is the director of the unique performing and recording group of 4 pianists known as Grimoire. 

His interest in contemporary music - especially by British composers - has led to many commissioned magazine articles and a series of albums of new music for young musicians published by Bosworths/Music Sales. He has also been an Advisor to the London Arts Board on aspects of contemporary music and jazz, and is involved with the setting, and examining, of the higher grade and diploma levels of the Trinity piano syllabus. In 2006 he was given the Chairman's Award by Trinity College London for services to musical assessment.
