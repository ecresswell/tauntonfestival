<h3>The First Taunton Film Festival 2015</h3>
<p>The Taunton Festival of the Arts Film Festival 2015 will be held at The SPACE (Tacchi-Morris location) on Sunday, 22nd November at 1.30pm for 2.00pm start.</p>
<p>Students ranging from Preparatory level through to Sixth Form have submitted entries, these will be screened at the festival and awards presented.  In addition, some films produced by other students, recognised and awarded at other film festival events, will be screened.   Combined with the additional screenings will be an interactive seminar style presentation covering basic film design and production, but emphasising the requirements being sought by the adjudicators.  The event should prove invaluable to creative filmmakers and is anticipated to run through until 4.00-4.30pm.</p>
<p>There is an entry charge of £7 to cover costs of the venue and the production of programme and notes for everyone.  Refreshments will be available.</p>

In the Full Open (E) 1st place prize is £100, 2nd place £50 and third place £30.<br />
There will be an additional £100 for the entry considered to be the overall Best Entry.</p>
<p>The Year groups apply at the time of the Film Festival</p>
<p>Categories A to C will not exceed a PG classification<br />
Categories D to E will not exceed a 15 classification</p>
<p>An entry will not be judged by its’ length, hence a short high quality production may be more worthy than a longer film.  Much consideration has been given as to how entries will be judged and how constraining guidelines will be applied.  This year only classification will be constraining.  The judges may decide to split a class according to genre if entry numbers are high.  A film may be entered for more than one category (for example a Year 10 student may enter their film for categories B, C and D, if they so wish). </p>
<p><strong>The closing date for entries is Monday, 19th October 2015</strong>.  Online entries and payment must be received by midnight on the closing date and the media postmarked 19th October at the latest.<br />
A Late Entry facility is available, which will have a deadline of Monday, 26th October 2015.  A Late Entry will be subject to an additional £10 for each class entered.</p>
<p>Entries will be online and payment by credit or debit card will also be available online.  However, the entry itself (the media) should be submitted to the secretary by post.  Cheques for entries may be sent with media submissions. Full details of the submission process will be online shortly.</p>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<p>Entries must fall within the stated classifications as listed for the classes.  This is so divided as to enable the maximum viewing audience to enjoy the entries.  </p>
<p>All valid entries will be screened.  Please refer to the guidelines issued by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) for a straightforward understanding of what is and what is not required for the creation of a project within a ‘PG’ or a ‘15’ classification.  If there are any uncertainties, then please email Taunton Festival for clarification.  Useful Link: <a href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk/what-classification/guidelines" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bbfc.co.uk/what-classification/guidelines', 'BBFC Guidelines (download guide)']);" >BBFC Guidelines (download guide)</a></p>
<p>All entries must be supplied in one of the following formats, which will provide scope for HD and non-HD productions, edited on PC or Apple systems:</p>
<p>.mov .mp4 .avi</p>
<p>Your entry should be sent on a memory stick or SDHC card.  Please ensure that your production runs properly from the memory stick/card before submitting.  Memory sticks/cards will not be returned.  Therefore, be certain that you retain a safe copy of your production, yourself.  Whilst Taunton Festival will make every effort, no responsibility can be accepted for the loss of memory sticks/cards and related media.</p>
<p>There is a DVD about the Film Festival, including tips and links about making films.  This is available free.  Please email Taunton Festival requesting a copy and providing your name and address.</p>
<p>Here are some useful ‘Make a Movie’ sites to explore (there are more on the DVD).  This is not exclusive (just a start), and you will find that browsing via Google will reveal a wealth of helpful information, also You Tube.  Good luck.</p>
