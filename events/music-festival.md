Welcome to the Music Festival page of the Taunton Festival of the Arts. Please see the Events Calendar for details.

### [Taunton Young Musician]({{ '/events/music-festival/taunton-young-musician/' | prepend: site.github.url }})

The Trustees of the Festival have established a fund, designated to provide prizes for young musicians who have demonstrated outstanding musical ability. Run on competitive lines, the competition aims to assist and encourage musical excellence amongst students living in the Taunton area.

### [Taunton Junior Young Musician]({{ '/events/music-festival/taunton-junior-young-musician/' | prepend: site.github.url }})

TJYM began as an addition to TYM, but it was felt it should have its own identity as a separate competition. 

### [Taunton Young Singer (Grade VI+)]({{ '/events/music-festival/taunton-young-singer/' | prepend: site.github.url }})

This competition for young singers has been set up by the festival in response to the ever-growing number of entries in the Music Festival. It was also felt that singers should have their own competition and not be judged alongside their instrumental contemporaries as in past Taunton Young Musicians competitions.

### [Taunton Junior Young Singer]({{ '/events/music-festival/taunton-junior-young-singer' | prepend: site.github.url }})

The Taunton Junior Young Singer of the Year competition has been created following the success of Taunton Junior Young Musician in 2014/15 and the ever growing interest in the Taunton Young Singer competitions.

### [Taunton Young Music Theatre Singer]({{ '/events/music-festival/taunton-young-music-theatre-singer/' | prepend: site.github.url }})

Competitors are invited to perform a programme from different periods and genres, up to a maximum of ten minutes. Movement will be permitted, if appropriate, but not costume or props. 

### [Somerset Song Prize (18-26)]({{ '/events/music-festival/somerset-song-prize/' | prepend: site.github.url }})

The Somerset Song Prize is a prestigious competition promoted by the Festival, Somerset Opera, and the Ronald Tickner Educational Trust, first run in May 2013 and is a biennial event.
