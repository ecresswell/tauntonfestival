She is currently a teacher of Speech and Drama, a member of the LAMDA Examining Board and a British and International Federation of Festivals adjudicator, work which has taken her on her travels again from Singapore to Sri Lanka as well as Africa, the Middle East and Europe. She still performs – when she has time, and as a writer, has realised a long standing ambition to have two book of her poems published, called  “POEMS FOR CHILDREN TO ENJOY – AND TEACHERS TOO”.  and “MORE POEMS FOR CHILDREN TO ENJOY AND TEACHERS TOO” and  a selection of monologues and duologues for young performers, “SCENES FOR YOUNG PERFORMERS TO ENJOY”. She is always pleased to share the enthusiasm and talent of young Festival performers. She is looking forward to being part of the Taunton Festival .
