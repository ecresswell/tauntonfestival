                    <h2>7th Taunton Young Musician of the Year Competition 2012</h2>
<p>The First Round of this year’s Taunton Young Musician of the Year Competition drew 19 incredibly talented and enthusiastic students, again posing difficult decisions for the selection committee in choosing 5 finalists. In the event 7 were selected to proceed to the final round of the Competition which was held Queen’s Hall on 20 January 2013.</p>
<p>They are Edward Creed (piano), Alice Brook (clarinet), Ellen Tiso (clarinet), Hera Bradly (cello), Natalie Too (cello), Lucy Bray (soprano) and Hannah Deasy (soprano).</p>
<p>13 years old Nazariy Alexandryants has been nominated this year&#8217;s Taunton Junior Musician of the Year which includes prize money plus the Jefferson Horsley Trophy. The runners up junior prize goes to a 12 years old French horn player, Gregory Steward.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s unsuccessful students who without exception played or sang very well, are warmly congratulated on their performances and strongly encouraged to try again next year.</p>

<p>The final round of the 7th Taunton Young Musician of the Year drew, despite the weather, a responsive and supportive audience to Queen’s Hall on Sunday 20 January.</p>
<p>The adjudicators Colin Touchin (Chairman), Graeme Humphrey and Melanie Armitstead had travelled from as far afield as Coventry and London to judge the competition and they were faced with a challenging afternoon. The standard was again very high resulting in some lovely performances from all competitors.</p>
<p>In the event first prize was awarded to Edward Creed, a pianist aged15 from WellsCathedralSchool. 2nd prize went to soprano Lucy Bray who is currently working through a gap year (previously Exeter School) and 3rd prize to Natalie Too, a cellist from Queen’s College also aged 15.</p>
<p>The other four finalists all deserve much recognition for their hard work and enjoyable performances. Richard Huish College students Ellen Tiso and Alice Brooks, both demonstrated not just their skills but the capabilities of the clarinet! From Taunton School came soprano Hannah Deasy whose recital included 2 very well delivered songs by Michael Head. And the youngest competitor cellist Hera Bradley, who at 14 is certainly one to watch out for. Hera is a Taunton School student.</p>
<p>Last year&#8217;s winner, pianist Weng Soon Tee, treated the audience to a stunning prelude by Rachmaninoff before the adjudicators, announced the winners. The Mayor of Taunton Deane, Councillor Terry Hall, presented Edward Creed with the trophy, donated by Shakspeare Glass, in addition to prizes for each finalist.</p>
