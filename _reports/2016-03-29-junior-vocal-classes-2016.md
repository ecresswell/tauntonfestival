                    <p>The Junior Vocal classes of the Music festival go from strength to strength: three and a half days of young people between the ages of eight to eighteen singing mostly solos, some duets and finally a morning of choirs, when 450 performers filled the hall, creating a great atmosphere of commitment and wholehearted enjoyment. Gaynor Keeble, the adjudicator for all the classes, never failed to deliver praise, positive strokes and constructive comment.  (Vocal secretary Linda Marshall Cole)</p>
