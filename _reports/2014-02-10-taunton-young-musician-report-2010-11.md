                    <h2>5th Taunton Young Musician of the Year Competition</h2>
<p>The audience at Queen’s Hall, for the Final Round of the Taunton Young Musician of the Year Competition on Sunday, was treated to a rare variety of young talent; four piano finalists alternated with bassoon, cello and tuba. Mollie Stannard from Taunton School, playing a bassoon marginally shorter than her, and King’s College cellist Tamar Dewbery, both gave excellent and varied programmes. The only common factor amongst the pianists was the piano! The mostly jazz recital of the talented Blundell’s School student, Alex Everett, contrasted with the classical recitals of Queen’s College students Asako Onishi and Weng Soon Tee (who fully justified the award of third prize). Tom Francombe, a student at Richard Huish College, gave a very lively and enjoyable performance on tuba, truly communicating with the audience and thoroughly deserving second place. But the top prize was taken by the brilliant playing of 12 years old Kirsty Chaplin who is a joint piano/harp specialist at Wells Cathedral School. Kirsty will also have the opportunity of performing with the Taunton Sinfonietta in one of their forthcoming concerts and of progressing to the National Rotary Young Musician Competition.</p>
<p>The distinguished judges, all conductors, were Chairman Keith Allen, Anthony Negus and Angus Watson. The Chairman spoke highly of the standard of performance of all competitors. The Mayor of Taunton Deane Councillor Jefferson Horsley presented the prizes including a cheque for £200, plus a striking glass trophy donated by Shakspeare Glass. The Mayor emphasized his commitment to music for young people, no mean task in the face of cuts.</p>
<p>The competition was hosted by Queen’s College and funded by the Taunton &#038; Somerset Music &#038; Drama Festival and the Rotary Clubs of Taunton, Taunton Vale and Wellington.”</p>
