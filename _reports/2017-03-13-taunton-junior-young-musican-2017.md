We had nine musicians playing trumpet, flute, clarinet, guitar, piano and saxophone. Our adjudicator, Richard Deering, a very experienced performer and examiner, complimented them on the standard of their playing and their choice of repertoire. He also gave them useful tips on presentation, and not worrying about the odd wrong note!  "Think about the style and what you want to convey to your listeners. Enjoy your performance and your audience will also."  And judging by the comments afterwards, they did!

1st prize and the Jefferson Horsley trophy was awarded to Matthew Osborne, ( trumpet) from King’s Hall School. Joint 2nd prizes went to two clarinettists, Abigail Hopwood from Queen’s College and Ellen Steward from Wells Cathedral School.
