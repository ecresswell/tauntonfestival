                    <p>When you open the entries for Taunton Junior Young Musician, you hope for variety, and this year’s competition in Temple Methodist Church did not disappoint. We heard Ellen Steward on clarinet, Kate Jackson , recorder; Heidi Blades , piano ; Ella Leonard, oboe ; Alex Christopher, trumpet ; Ben Shattock, piano and Poppy McGhee, recorder . The pieces chosen were challenging, and one had to remind oneself that these students were aged between 9 and 14 yrs, and all were of Grade V standard or higher.</p>
<p>As Stephen Bell our adjudicator, speaking to the musicians, said, “ Yes, it was a competition, so I had to choose a winner, but actually you gave us a concert, with great variety and an excellent standard of performance.” He thanked the teachers and parents for their support and hoped that all the students would continue to get pleasure from making music.</p>
<p>The worthy winner was Ella Leonard, oboe, playing pieces by Britten, Michael Head and Albinoni. She received the Jefferson Horsley trophy and £100.</p>

<p><strong>Update, 9th April, 2015</strong><br />
Having won the Taunton Junior Young Musician Competition, Ella Leonard was selected to take part in the Rotary District Music Competition at the Kings of Wessex School in Cheddar on Sunday 1st March as the Taunton Rotary Club entrant. Not only was she the winner of that competition but was also awarded the cup for the best performance of the afternoon pitted against the singers who were taking part in the Vocal section of the competition. She will now go forward to the Rotary Regional Competition to take place in Plymouth on April 19th. Congratulations Ella!</p>
