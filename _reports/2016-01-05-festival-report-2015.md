                    <p>The 101st Music Festival, held in Taunton School, Temple Methodist Church, and Queen’s College Taunton, saw yet another wonderful packed week of music making &#8211;  the move from November to February has proved an encouraging one, with more entrants than ever before. </p>
<p>The <strong>Piano Day</strong> got the week off to a happy start. From the very small, who whispered the name of their piece, to the very advanced , who left the stage with a bow and a smile, all seemed to enjoy the experience. Adjudicator, Elizabeth Brazier, encouraged all the students to practise playing from memory and to persevere with the dreaded sight reading! She offered praise and instruction in a firm but sensitive way, always stressing the importance of enjoyment .  The day ended with a wonderful Recital class by students from Sherborne School for Girls.  (Gwyn Flitters)</p>
<p>The <strong>Wind Day</strong> also demonstrated an increase in numbers, as accomplished recorder players, and cheerful brass and woodwind performers gave of their best to the kindly and helpful adjudicator, Colin Bradbury. New duet and Jazz classes added an exciting  element.  Excellent playing came from the Taunton Children’s Orchestra, and thrilling performances from Castle School’s Percussion Band, Steel Bands and Jazz Band.    (Hilary Daniel)  </p>
<p>The <strong>Strings Day</strong> produced some lovely playing by very young string players; a good number of performers entered the Guitar classes, and two harpists gave delightful renditions on this beautiful instrument.  Trull School entered 4 recorder groups in the Group Tuition Ensemble class and played to a high standard. The Castle School Senior Clarinet Quintet in the Chamber Music class achieved one of the rare ‘Outstanding’ awards from the experienced and constructive adjudicator, Kathryn Hardman. (Michael Chapman)</p>
<p>The <strong>Vocal Day</strong> experienced 2 stunning days of vocal competition, with young people from ages of 8 to 18, in unprecedented numbers.  Singing is alive and well in this corner of Somerset!  The two excellent adjudicators, Sarah Jefferies and Alison Sutton were very impressed by the high standard of the young singers, and frequently complimented them on the quality of their performances.
