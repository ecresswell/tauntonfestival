                    <h2>102nd  Taunton Festival of the Arts</h2>
<p>The first event of the 102nd Taunton Festival of the Arts is the Music Festival, which takes place during the first 2 weeks of February at Taunton School, Temple Methodist Church and Queen’s College. </p>
<p>The <strong>Piano Day</strong>, held at Taunton School, which needed an extra morning to fit in all the numbers of pianists, was extremely enjoyable, and people stayed on after their classes had finished in order to listen to the excellent adjudicator, Alan McLean.  He managed to be both energetic and sensitive, and every student felt they mattered.  Instead of merely talking, he ran the classes like a series of mini-workshops, bringing children back to the piano to iron out problems.  Teachers and parents were full of praise for this approach.  He gave 4 Outstanding marks and 46 Distinctions and praised the standard of teaching in our area. (Piano and Keyboard Secretary Gwynneth Flitters)  </p>
<p>The <strong>Wind Day</strong> at Temple Methodist Church was a great success. In the morning lots of different shapes and sizes of recorders were played by enthusiastic youngsters; in the afternoon, the Taunton Children’s Orchestra gave a splendid performance of their varied programme, some playing instruments nearly as big as themselves. The brass and woodwind classes followed with some fine playing, especially in the recently included Jazz classes. The day concluded with a lively performance of the Junction 25 Concertina Band, who gained distinction in both classes.  The highly experienced  adjudicator, James Stretton presided over the day with kindly and constructive comments to each and every performer.    (Wind Secretary Hilary Daniel)  </p>
<p>The <strong>Strings Classes and Instrumental Groups</strong> held over 2 days at Temple Methodist Church were very well attended and contained some delightful performances. There were several worthy winners of new trophies for Guitar Classes, generously donated by teacher Feroze Pomeroy, with Millie Baker winning both the Intermediate Guitar Trophy and the 12 years and under Guitar Trophy, and Chester Johnson, who was awarded a distinction by adjudicator Rachel Greenwood, which won him the Junior Guitar Trophy.</p>
<p>The only Outstanding award over the 2 days was given to a truly outstanding player, 10 year old Poppy McGhee, who also achieved several distinctions for her violin and ‘cello playing. She came away with the Hamilton Lawrence Cup, the Mills Cup and the Transitional Trophy Cup.  Violinist, Annie Tiso performed to a very high standard and won the Nesta FranklynTrophy and the Trewin Cup, with distinctions in both classes. The friendly atmosphere created in the church provided the very best conditions for all candidates to perform to their best standards and everyone was appreciative of the support given to the Festival by the members of the Temple Methodist Church. (Strings Secretary Sandra Sutton)</p>
