                    <p>The 2011 Festival, held in Temple Methodist Church and Queen’s College Taunton, saw yet another successful year of Drama and Music, with performances from hundreds of young people.</p>
<p>Piano classes extended over 1½ days with adjudicator, Fiona Chryssides who was very pleased with the number of entries and the high standard of playing, awarding many Distinctions and three Outstanding certificates. She praised the standard of teaching in our area and the hard work obviously put in by the students.</p>
<p>Wind classes created an atmosphere alive with music from baroque to present day with all competitors enjoying Peter Merry’s adjudication. Sometimes the youth of today receive a bad press but for anyone attending the Wind day on Tuesday there was a different story to tell. There were very young students clutching recorders, cellos bigger than their players, bassoons, french horns and enormous steel pans &#8211; a truly eclectic mix!</p>
<p>String classes. 127 performers in 28 different classes displayed encouraging talent, playing orchestral stringed instruments, including harp, and guitars. Ages ranged from the very young to adult. Chamber ensembles, including family groups added colour &#038; some excitement to a full day. Adjudicator Andrew Sherwood encouraged and inspired throughout, using his expertise and experience to offer much technical and musical help.</p>
<p>Vocal classes. The key word for the two days of vocal classes was variety, with singing of a high standard from all ages. The range of voice qualities and styles covered everything from Bach to Sister Act. The Junior and Senior Choir classes created a real ‘buzz’ among performers and hugely supportive audience alike; parents clearly felt that the young singers were privileged to be taking part in such rewarding music making. </p>
