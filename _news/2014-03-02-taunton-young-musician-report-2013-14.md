                    <p>This year the Preliminary Round was held at Taunton School and, for the first time did not include singers.  This is because singers will now have their own competition, Taunton Young Singer of the Year, which will be held on Sunday, 9th March in 2014 in the Temple Methodist church. </p>
<p>Sunday, 17th November, saw 13 young instrumentalists performing with musicality  and focus to a very high standard indeed.  The range of instruments was wide: from violin to double bass, from clarinet to bassoon and trumpet to pianists.  Experienced adjudicator, Elizabeth Hayley, said it was a difficult task to choose the 5 Finalists from such a talented group of musicians. However, 5 performers who go through to the Final Round are; Carey Andrews (piano), Anya Lee (viola), Josephine Jobbins (double bass), Joe Prindl (double bass)and Mollie Stallard (bassoon).<br />
13 year old Gregory Steward, trumpeter, won the Taunton Junior Musician of the Year prize, plus the Jefferson Horsley Trophy.</p>
