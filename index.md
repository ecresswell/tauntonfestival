Formed in 1913, the Taunton & Somerset Music, Drama & Dance Festival has undergone a name change – Taunton Festival of the Arts – to reflect more closely its activities and to allow for additional events. The festival is affiliated to the British and International Federation of Festivals (<http://www.federationoffestivals.org.uk>) and the Taunton Association of Performing Arts (<http://www.tapa.org.uk>).
