**(formerly Taunton & Somerset Music, Drama & Dance Festival)**

Formed in 1913, the Taunton & Somerset Music, Drama & Dance Festival has undergone a name change – Taunton Festival of the Arts – to reflect more closely its activities and to allow for additional events. The festival is affiliated to the British and International Federation of Festivals (www.federationoffestivals.org.uk) and the Taunton Association of Performing Arts (www.tapa.org.uk).

The festival exists to encourage and promote the performance and enjoyment of arts. Aiming particularly, but not exclusively, at young people it provides a challenge and a unique opportunity to perform in a competitive and non-competitive situation in front of adjudicators, all experienced professionals, offering teaching at the highest level.

Music classes are held in piano, strings, woodwind, brass, recorders, composition and vocal. Drama classes include verse speaking, prepared reading, public speaking, mime, and acting. Dance classes include Classical, Cabaret, Ballet, Character, Modern, Tap, Song & Dance, Lyrical and Choreography.

A Film Festival has also been introduced.

Competitors receive verbal and written adjudication scripts and certificates. Cups, trophies and medals are awarded in some classes.
